                <br><p>Tips for spotting misinformation:</p>
                <br>
                    Be critical.<br><h6>Always consider the reason for something being written before taking it seriously. <br>Be wary if the purpose of it seems to be to persuade you into thinking or sharing something in particular.</h6>
                    <br>Check the source.<br><h6>Look into the background of the author, the web address of the site, or the language used. <br>These can indicate whether a source is trustworthy or not.</h6>
                    <br>Do extra research.<br><h6>If you read something, why not look it up to see if others have reported on the same thing. <br>Find some reputable sources with the same information and you’re good to go.</h6>
                    <br>Check the evidence.<h6>Reliable information will reference plenty of sources, such as scientific data, official statistics, or quotes from experts.</h6>

           <p><h7>Types of misinformation</h7></p>
            <br>
            <p>Articles</p>
             <p><h6>News Articles are often your leading source of daily information. But what happens when there are an increasing number of sources, especially with the development of social media and internet presences? It may be hard to keep track of all these sources. This leads to problems of reliability and legitimacy.</h6></p>
                <br><img src="img/Article.png" alt="Graph" class="center">
            <br><p>Clickbait</p>
                <p><h6>Organisations may resort to clickbait to get revenue from readers as they know how to make headlines eye-catching. Clickbait titles are designed for the purpose of attracting attention so that users will be drawn to follow through to the source. As it is just used for the view rate, the content is usually not reliable and sometimes not even relevant.</h6></p>
            <br><p>Graphs</p>
                <p><h6>At a brief glance, this graph indicating COVID-19 cases in the U.S seems ordinary.</h6></p>
                <br><img src="img/Graph.png" alt="Graph" class="center">  
                <br><p><h6>However, a closer look can show how the X and Y axis is manipulated with an inconsistent scale.</h6></p>
                <p><h6>Data can be manipulated to fit the narrative being shown to the viewer. In this case, perhaps the aim of using skewed axis' was to downplay the growth of COVID-19 cases. This is a common tactic that is used in many other forms. Many people may not notice this adjustment, and will take it as a fact from a reputable source. It is in your best interest to take extra care in viewing data and it's source.</h6></p>
